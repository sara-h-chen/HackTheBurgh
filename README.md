# HackTheBurgh
### Goggle?
-------------------------------------------------------------
This tool is primarily designed for programmers who struggle with visual difficulties. Although the initial intention was for this tool to help programmers with dyslexia or poor eyesight, it can be used by anyone, even if it's just to relieve tired eyes.

When enabled, the Chrome extension will zoom in on elements of the page upon mouse-over and click. On right-click (or shift-click?), the highlighted word will be read aloud to the developer, using the API. Extension: we can integrate web speech to allow speech interaction/dictation to the machine.

On a simpler level, it can be used for older people with near-sightedness, or children learning to read.

-------------------------------------------------------------

This Chrome extension will be written with the Google Developers' API, Speech Synthesis.
The zoom on mouse-over uses Magnifier.js.
